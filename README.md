# GoodEats

## iOS Apps created with (Swift 4.2/Xcode 10.1)

## Small application in which I try to clone the Glovo app, in this first stage I have implemented the structure of the application.

To present the different categories I'm using UITableView, when the user interacts with the category, it shows all the corresponding content in a UICollectionView.***

Once you have selected the category, you will be able to see the detail of each element of the category

**For the second stage of application development, I am considering applying filters, sharing recipes through social networks, displaying more information in the detail view.**
